I have completed a project in Cisco Packet Tracer that involves creating and configuring a complex network. This project includes both logical and physical network maps, configurations of network devices and servers, as well as a detailed description of network operation. Additionally, essential network services such as resource sharing and printer sharing have been implemented and documented. The connections between buildings are established using fiber optic technology.
